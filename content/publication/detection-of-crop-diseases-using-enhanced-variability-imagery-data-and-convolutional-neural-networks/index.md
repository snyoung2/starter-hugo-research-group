abstract: The timely detection of crop diseases is critical for securing crop
  productivity, lowering production costs, and minimizing agrochemical use. This
  study presents a crop disease identification method that is based on
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on images taken with
  consumer-grade cameras. Specifically, this study addresses the early detection
  of wheat yellow rust, stem rust, powdery mildew, potato late blight, and wild
  barley net blotch. To facilitate this, pictures were taken in situ without
  modifying the scene, the background, or controlling the illumination. Each
  image was then split into several patches, thus retaining the original spatial
  resolution of the image while allowing for data variability. The resulting
  dataset was highly diverse since the disease manifestation, imaging geometry,
  and illumination varied from patch to patch. This diverse dataset was used to
  train various CNN architectures to find the best match. The resulting
  classification accuracy was 95.4 Â± 0.4%. These promising results lay the
  groundwork for autonomous early detection of plant diseases. Guidelines for
  implementing this approach in realistic conditions are also discussed.
