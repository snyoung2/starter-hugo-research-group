<font size="3">The DAISy (Digital Agro-environment and Intelligent Systems) Lab advances design approaches and develops new use cases for robotic and sensor systems to monitor environmental and agricultural processes. Our interdisciplinary team utilizes and integrates a variety of technologies, including sensor instrumentation, imaging systems, and aerial, surface, and ground vehicles to create systems with new and unique capabilities. Research in the DAISy Lab ultimately aims to advance the use of robotics for specific use cases and to solve practical problems in agricultural and environmental engineering. Applications include evaluating water quality, measuring earth surface processes, and monitoring crops across a variety of agricultural production systems.  </font>
